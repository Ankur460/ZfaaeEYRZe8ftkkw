# New Things I have learned while Developing this project are
React Component Composition: Building different parts of a web application as separate components (e.g., NavBar, CandidateDetails, BMICalculator) helps in maintaining a structured and modular codebase.

State Management with React Hooks: Utilizing React hooks like useState to manage and update the state within components allows for handling user inputs (weight and height in the BMI calculator) and dynamically displaying results.

Handling User Input and Validations: Implementing input fields for user data (weight and height) and validating that input to ensure it meets specified criteria (valid range) is crucial for data accuracy and application reliability.

Conditional Rendering: Using conditional statements to display content conditionally (such as displaying BMI results only after calculation) improves user experience and prevents unnecessary content display.

Anchor Tags and File Downloads: Understanding how anchor tags (<a>) work in HTML and using the download attribute to initiate file downloads (in this case, the candidate's resume) directly from the browser.

Deploying React App On GitHub: Understanding how we can deploy a react app on github pages.
